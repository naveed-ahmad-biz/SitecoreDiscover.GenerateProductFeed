<h2>Purpose</h2>
 <p>This sample code converts the /me/product call from Sitecore OrderCloud into a TAB file as per the specficiations given at https://doc.sitecore.com/discover/en/developers/discover-developer-guide/product-data-feed-specifications.html</p>
 
 <p>The TAB file can then be used to send data to Sitecore Discover for initial bulk upload.</p>
 
 <p>The JSON file is generated from the Sitecore's PLAY! Shop demo instance by calling /me/product API call. The response of the call is stored in the JSON file.</p>
 
 <p>The /me/product call is used by the PLAY!Shop demo to display initial list of products for an anonymous user.</p>
 <p>The code is provided as-is without any warranty. This is a starting point, you will have to adjust the code and data models as per the  JSON output/response for your own shop.</p>
